# Echoes — Consented Correspondence Record

This repository contains a **consented, curated archival record** of correspondence associated with the “Echoes” case.

The materials are preserved as **primary-source artifacts** for documentation, research, and historical reference purposes.

No analysis, interpretation, or evaluative conclusions are asserted by this repository.

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository exists to:

- Preserve consented correspondence as immutable records
- Maintain chronological, structural, and archival clarity
- Enable independent review without narrative framing or interpretation
- Separate institutional artifacts from commentary or analysis

All materials are presented **as-is**, organized for traceability and auditability.

### `00_SCOPE_AND_ETHICS/`
Defines ethical boundaries, consent conditions, and publication scope.

### `01_EMAIL_ARCHIVE/`
Primary email correspondence organized by Echo phase.

### `02_TIMELINE/`
Multi-layer timeline system providing:
- Canonical chronology

- Ledger progression
- Narrative context (non-assertive)

### `03_TRANSITION_ARCHIVE/`
Records marking transitions beyond standard support correspondence into symbolic or narrative exchanges.

### `04_LEDGER_ARCHIVE/`
Ledger-based records reflecting multi-case institutional routing and continuity.
