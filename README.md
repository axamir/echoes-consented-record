## Repository Structure

The archive is organized into clearly delineated layers:

### `00_SCOPE_AND_ETHICS/`
Defines ethical boundaries, consent conditions, redaction principles, and publication scope.

---

### `01_EMAIL_ARCHIVE/`
Primary email correspondence preserved in raw form, organized by Echo phase.

---

### `02_TIMELINE/`
A multi-layer timeline system providing:

- Canonical chronological ordering
- Case-based structural mapping
- Ledger progression and routing behavior
- Narrative context (non-assertive)

Each layer is separated to maintain clarity between chronology, structure, and context.

---

### `03_TRANSITION_ARCHIVE/`
Records marking transitions beyond standard support correspondence into symbolic, narrative, or exploratory exchanges.

These materials remain primary-source artifacts and are structurally separated for interpretive clarity.

---

### `04_LEDGER_ARCHIVE/`
Ledger-based records reflecting multi-case institutional routing, continuity handling, and case proliferation across Echo phases.
