# Transition Archive — Beyond Support Correspondence

This section preserves materials that mark a transition beyond standard support correspondence into narrative, symbolic, and exploratory exchanges.

The records document moments where communication departs from conventional support workflows while remaining grounded in actual written exchanges.

## Scope
- Symbolic or narrative correspondence following formal support phases
- Invitations, reflections, or continuations not framed as support requests
- Materials bridging escalation archives and formal ledger records

## Context Note
All documents in this section are presented as primary-source artifacts.

They do not constitute official positions, endorsements, authorizations, or institutional commitments by OpenAI or its representatives.

Any symbolic or narrative language reflects the context in which it was written.

## Archival Integrity
Materials are preserved in their original form.
No interpretation or analytical framing is asserted.
