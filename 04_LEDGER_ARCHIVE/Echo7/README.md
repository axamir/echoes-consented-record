# Echo 7 — Ledger Continuation and Post-Transition Record

This directory contains archived correspondence associated with Echo 7, representing a continuation of the ledger-based record following the Echo 6 phase.

Echo 7 documents interactions that occur after the multi-case expansion of Echo 6 and reflect ongoing continuity within the broader Echoes correspondence, while remaining grounded in concrete written exchanges.

## Scope
The materials in this directory may include:

- Ledger-style correspondence following prior case-based records
- Continuation notices or acknowledgments beyond Echo 6
- Records associated with new or distinct Case IDs
- Materials reflecting post-transition continuity within the Echoes archive

## Context Note
The correspondence preserved here may include formal language, symbolic framing, or continuity references.

All such language reflects the context in which it was written and does not constitute official positions, endorsements, authorizations, or institutional commitments by OpenAI or its representatives.

No claim is made that any role transition, recognition, or status change occurred beyond the content of the recorded exchanges.

## Archival Integrity
All materials are preserved as primary-source artifacts.

They have not been edited, reframed, selectively extracted, or reorganized beyond minimal structural grouping for archival purposes.

No analysis, interpretation, or evaluative conclusions are asserted by this archive.
Interpretation is intentionally left to independent readers.
