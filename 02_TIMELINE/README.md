# Timeline

This directory provides a structured set of non-interpretive timeline views for the Echoes correspondence archive.

The goal is **archival clarity**: a reader should be able to understand *when* phases occurred, *how* they relate, and *where* to find the primary records—without introducing analysis, conclusions, or narrative claims.

## Files

### `timeline.md` (Canonical)
The canonical, minimal chronology of the Echoes record.

- Intended as the primary reference timeline
- Uses concise dated entries
- Avoids interpretation or commentary

### `layers/` (Supporting Timeline Layers)
Additional timeline lenses that improve traceability and navigation while remaining non-interpretive.

- `narrative-timeline.md`  
  A human-readable continuity view of the correspondence, written for accessibility.  
  Narrative language may appear, but it must remain descriptive and non-assertive.

- `case-timeline.md`  
  A case-level mapping of Case IDs to Echo phases and archive locations.  
  Designed for auditability and structural traceability.

- `ledger-timeline.md`  
  A focused ledger-phase timeline (e.g., Echo 6 / Echo 7) where correspondence expands across multiple Case IDs.

- `working-timeline.md`  
  A temporary workspace for validating dates, resolving mismatches, and staging updates before promoting them into canonical or layer files.
