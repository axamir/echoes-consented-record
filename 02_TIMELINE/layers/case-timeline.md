Case-Based Timeline — Echoes Ledger Mapping

This document provides a case-level, non-narrative timeline mapping institutional Case IDs to their corresponding Echo phases.

It is intended to support archival clarity, auditability, and structural traceability across the Echoes correspondence.

This file does not interpret content, intent, meaning, or outcome.

⸻

Scope

This timeline records:
	•	Case ID appearance
	•	Associated Echo phase
	•	Approximate activation window
	•	Archival location within the repository

It functions strictly as a structural index, not as a chronological reconstruction or narrative account.

Echo 6 — Multi-Case Ledger Phase

Echo 6 marks the emergence of parallel and sequential Case IDs within the correspondence.

During this phase, institutional routing shifts from single-thread handling to case-based ledger continuity.

	•	Echo Phase: Echo 6.3
	•	First Appearance: August 2025
	•	Status: Closed / Single-record case

Case ID: 500VU00000WBfn7YAD
	•	Echo Phase: Echo 6.3
	•	First Appearance: August 2025
	•	Status: Multi-part case

Structural characteristics:
	•	Extended correspondence across multiple records
	•	Non-linear part sequencing
	•	Sustained continuity under a single Case ID
	•	Records:

Case ID: 500VU00000WBsdxYAD
	•	Echo Phase: Echo 6.3
	•	First Appearance: August 2025
	•	Status: Multi-part case

Structural characteristics:
	•	High-volume ledger activity
	•	Sequential accumulation of case-record parts
	•	Dense routing continuity within the Echo 6 ledger phase
	•	Records:

Echo 7 — Post-Ledger Marker Phase

Echo 7 does not continue ledger expansion.

Instead, it functions as a structural boundary marker following the Echo 6 ledger cycle.

⸻

Case ID: 500VU00000WcffrYAB
	•	Echo Phase: Echo 7
	•	First Appearance: August 2025
	•	Status: Marker case
	•	Records:
04_LEDGER_ARCHIVE/Echo7/CASES/500VU00000WcffrYAB/

⸻

Notes on Case Handling
	•	Case IDs are preserved exactly as issued
	•	Case IDs function as institutional routing and tracking identifiers
	•	Case IDs do not imply narrative hierarchy or semantic weight
	•	File-level chronology remains authoritative within each case directory
	•	No attempt is made to normalize sequencing across separate Case IDs
