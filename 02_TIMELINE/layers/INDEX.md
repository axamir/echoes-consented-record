# Timeline Index — Echoes Archive

This index provides a structured entry point to the **multi-layered timeline system** used in the Echoes Consented Record.

The timelines are intentionally separated by function to preserve archival clarity, auditability, and interpretive boundaries.

Readers may choose the layer most appropriate to their purpose.

---

## Canonical Timeline

### `timeline.md`
**Purpose:**  
Authoritative chronological ordering of Echo phases.

**Use this if you want:**
- A neutral, date-ordered overview
- A single source of temporal truth
- No narrative, case, or ledger interpretation

This file defines *when* each Echo phase occurred.

---

## Timeline Layers

All supplemental timelines are located in the `layers/` directory.

---

### Case-Based Timeline

#### `layers/case-timeline.md`
**Purpose:**  
Maps Case IDs to their associated Echo phases.

**Use this if you want:**
- Case-level traceability
- Institutional routing clarity
- Cross-referencing between Case IDs and Echo phases

This file defines *which cases appeared where*.

---

### Ledger Timeline

#### `layers/ledger-timeline.md`
**Purpose:**  
Documents the transition into ledger-based, multi-case correspondence.

**Use this if you want:**
- Understanding of Echo 6 and Echo 7 structural behavior
- Insight into ledger expansion and saturation
- Institutional continuity mapping without narrative framing

This file defines *how correspondence structure evolved*.

---

### Narrative Timeline

#### `layers/narrative-timeline.md`
**Purpose:**  
Provides a human-readable account of tonal and thematic shifts.

**Use this if you want:**
- Contextual understanding of the correspondence experience
- A guided reading flow for humans
- Narrative continuity without institutional claims

This file defines *how the experience felt*, not what it meant.

---

### Working Timeline (Internal)

#### `layers/working-timeline.md`
**Purpose:**  
Internal reconciliation and drafting workspace.

**Use this if you want:**
- To understand how timelines were aligned
- To review unresolved or provisional notes
- An internal view of archival normalization

This file is **non-canonical** and subject to change.

---

## Reading Guidance

- For factual grounding → start with `timeline.md`
- For institutional structure → see `case-timeline.md` and `ledger-timeline.md`
- For human context → see `narrative-timeline.md`
- For internal process → see `working-timeline.md`

No single timeline supersedes another; each serves a distinct archival function.

---

## Archival Note

All timeline files are derived from **primary-source materials** preserved elsewhere in the repository.

No timeline asserts:
- Institutional intent or recognition
- Validation of claims
- Interpretive conclusions

They exist solely to support **transparent navigation of the archive**.
