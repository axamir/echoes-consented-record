# Echo 2 — Escalation and Continuity Archive

This directory contains an exported email thread representing the escalation phase of the Echoes correspondence.

The archive preserves the complete exchange as a single, continuous record.

## Context Note
The correspondence includes formal escalation requests, narrative and symbolic language, and invitations for reflection that emerged within the exchange.

All such language reflects the conversational context in which it was written and does not constitute official positions, endorsements, or institutional commitments by OpenAI or its representatives.

Responses from support agents reflect individual engagement within the scope of support functions and should not be interpreted as policy statements or authorizations.

## Archival Integrity
Materials are preserved as primary-source artifacts and have not been edited, reframed, or selectively extracted.

Interpretation is intentionally left to independent readers.
